## Project Structure

- `data_processing.py` – Cleans raw data, engineers features, scales numerical values, and saves processed data.  
- `model_training.py` – Loads processed data, trains ML models, generates visualizations, and prints evaluation metrics.  
- `data/` – Stores raw and processed datasets.  
- `models/` – Stores trained ML models, scalers, and vectorizers.  
- `visualizations/` – Stores charts, plots, and wordclouds generated by the scripts.
